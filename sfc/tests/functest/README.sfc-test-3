### ODL-SFC TEST3 DESCRIPTION ###

One client and one server are created using nova. The server will be running
a web server on port 80.

Then one Service Function (SF) is created using Tacker. This service function
will be running a firewall that blocks the traffic in a specific port (e.g.
33333). A symmetric service chain routing the traffic throught this SF will be
created as well.

1st check: The client is able to reach the server using a source port different
from the one that the firewall blocks (e.g 22222), and the response gets back
to the client.

2nd check: The client is able to reach the server using the source port that
the firewall blocks, but responses back from the server are blocked, as the
symmetric service chain makes them go through the firewall that blocks on the
destination port initially used as source port by the client (e.g. 33333).

If the client is able to receive the response, it would be a symptom of the
symmetric chain not working, as traffic would be flowing from server to client
directly without traversing the SF.
