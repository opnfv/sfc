## These are the current available test cases ##

## TEST ONE CHAIN - sfc_one_chain_two_service_functions ##

We create one client and one server using nova. Then, 2 SFs are created using
tacker. A chain is created where both SFs are included.

vxlan_tool is started in both SFs and HTTP traffic is sent from the client to
the server. If it works, the vxlan_tool is modified to block HTTP traffic.
It is tried again and it should fail because packets are dropped. Then, that
SF stops blocking and the other SF starts blocking HTTP and the connection is
tried again.


## TEST TWO CHAINS - sfc_two_chains_SSH_and_HTTP ##

We create one client and one server using nova. Then, 2 SFs are created using
tacker. Two chains are created, having one SF each.

vxlan_tool is started in both SFs, one SF blocks SSH traffic and the other SF
block HTTP traffic. First, the client traffic is classified to chain1, where
HTTP should work but SSH sould not. This is tested and after that the
classification is changed to classified to chain2, where HTTP should not work
but SSH should work. This is tested again.


## TEST SYMMETRIC - sfc_symmetric_chain ##

One client and one server are created using nova. The server will be running
a web server on port 80.

Then one Service Function (SF) is created using Tacker. This service function
will be running a firewall that blocks the traffic in a specific port (e.g.
33333). A symmetric service chain routing the traffic throught this SF will be
created as well.

1st check: The client is able to reach the server and the response gets back
to the client. Here the firewall is ran without blocking any port.

2nd check: The client is not able to reach the server as the firewall
is configured to block traffic on port 80, and the request from the client 
is blocked, as the symmetric service chain makes them go through the firewall.

If the client is able to reach the server, it would be a symptom of the
symmetric chain not working, as traffic would be flowing from client to server
directly without traversing the SF.

3rd check: The client is able to reach the server, as the firewall 
is configured to block traffic on port 22222, and the response from the server 
is blocked.

If the server is able to reach the client, it would be a symptom of the
symmetric chain not working, as traffic would be flowing from server to client
directly without traversing the SF.

4th check: The client is able to reach the server uand the response gets back 
to the client. Like in 1st check to verify test ends with same config 
as at the beginning.


## TEST DELETION - sfc_chain_deletion ##

One client and one server are created using nova. Then a SF is created using tacker.
A service chain routing the traffic through this SF will be created as well.
After that the chain is deleted and re-created.

vxlan_tool is started in the SF and HTTP traffic is sent from the client to the server.
If it works, the vxlan_tool is modified to block HTTP traffic.
It is tried again and it should fail because packets are dropped.
