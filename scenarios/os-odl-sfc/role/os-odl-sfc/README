This is the role which deploys the os-odl-sfc scenarios in xci.

This role currently works with:

- OpenStack stable/pike
- ODL Nitrogen RC1
- OVS+NSH patch
- OpenSUSE 42.3 or Ubuntu 16.04

# PREPARATIONS #

1 - If you donâ€™t have a key already, generate an SSH key in $HOME/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa

2 - Clone OPNFV releng-xci repository
git clone https://gerrit.opnfv.org/gerrit/releng-xci.git

3 - Change into directory where the sandbox script is located:
cd releng-xci/xci

4 - Use a version of releng-xci which we know works

git checkout cf2cd4e4b87a5e392bc4ba49749a349925ba2f86

Then, depending on the scenario which will be run:

## os-odl-sfc-noha ##

To run os-odl-sfc-noha you should export the following variables before
running xci-deploy.sh. Note that you should change xxxx by the path where
your releng-xci code is:

export XCI_FLAVOR=noha
export OPNFV_SCENARIO=os-odl-sfc
export OPENSTACK_OSA_VERSION=stable/pike
export VM_MEMORY_SIZE=16384
export OPNFV_RELENG_DEV_PATH=/xxxxx/releng-xci


## os-odl-sfc-ha ##

To run os-odl-sfc-ha you should export the following variables before
running xci-deploy.sh:

export XCI_FLAVOR=ha
export OPNFV_SCENARIO=os-odl-sfc
export OPENSTACK_OSA_VERSION=stable/pike
export VM_MEMORY_SIZE=20480
export OPNFV_RELENG_DEV_PATH=/xxxxx/releng-xci



# LIMITATIONS #

1 - It is using a private branch for the os-neutron role. This is because
there are several patches pending to be upstreamed. This is the branch we
are using:

https://github.com/manuelbuil/openstack-ansible-os_neutron/tree/testing-ovs-nsh2

We will stop doing this as soon as the patches are merged upstream

2 -  It is using a private branch for tacker code because a bug does not
allow SSL. We will stop doing this as soon as the bug is fixed
