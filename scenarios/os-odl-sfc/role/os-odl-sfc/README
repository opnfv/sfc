# LIMITATIONS #

1 - It is using a private branch for the os-neutron role. This is because
there are several patches pending to be upstreamed. This is the branch we
are using:

https://github.com/manuelbuil/openstack-ansible-os_neutron/tree/testing-ovs-nsh2

We will stop doing this as soon as the patches are merged upstream

2 -  It is using a private branch for tacker code because a bug does not
allow SSL. We will stop doing this as soon as the bug is fixed
