This is the role which deploys the os-odl-sfc scenarios in xci.

This role currently works with:

- OpenStack stable/ocata
- ODL Nitrogen RC1
- OVS+NSH patch

# SCENARIOS #

export OPENSTACK_OSA_VERSION=stable/ocata
export VM_MEMORY_SIZE=16384
export OPNFV_RELENG_DEV_PATH=/xxxxx/releng-xci

# LIMITATIONS #

1 - It is using a private branch for the os-neutron role. This is because
there are several patches pending to be upstreamed. This is the branch we
are using:

https://github.com/mardim91/openstack-ansible-os_neutron/tree/ocata-backport-automated-twentyfourth-august

We will stop doing this as soon as the patches are merged upstream

2 -  It is using a private branch for tacker code because a bug does not
allow SSL. We will stop doing this as soon as the bug is fixed


# IN PROGRESS/FUTURE  #

1 - Supporting stable/Pike

2 - Support openSUSE
