# LIMITATIONS #

1 - It is using a private branch for the os-neutron role. This is because
there are several patches pending to be upstreamed. This is the branch we
are using:

https://github.com/mardim91/openstack-ansible-os_neutron/tree/ocata-backport-automated-twentyfourth-august

We will stop doing this as soon as the patches are merged upstream. For example:

https://review.openstack.org/#/c/496231/
https://review.openstack.org/#/c/497458/

2 -  Tacker is missing in this integration. Hopefully, it will be added in the
following days
