### ODL-SFC TEST2 DESCRIPTION ###

This is a simple description of the test case

We create one client and one server using nova. Then, 2 SFs are created using 
tacker. The SFs are deployed in two different compute nodes. A chain is created
where both SFs are included.

vxlan_tool is started in both SFs and HTTP traffic is sent from the client to
the server. If it works, the vxlan_tool is modified to block HTTP traffic.
It is tried again and it should fail because packets are dropped
