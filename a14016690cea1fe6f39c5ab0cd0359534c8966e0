      "message": "What is the purpose of this?\n\ndefault_param_file is just this, a file location where we give some default parameters (which is really a constant I initially took from config and that\u0027s why I didn\u0027t want to pass it as a parameter). The function autogenerates a temp file already if the user wants to do something else.\n\nMy initial thought was the following:\nIf you pass an availability zone to the function it will handle the file creation and the parameter passing, else it will default to a predefined file that will be there and point to the default nova av. zone. \n\nDo you think we need something more of this function?",
