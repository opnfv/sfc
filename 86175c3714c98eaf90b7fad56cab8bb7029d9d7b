      "message": "So I never modified this README after reworking the symmetric test case :( but I did the wiki so that has updated details. Basically, for 1st check, vxlan_tool is run without blocking ports. 2nd check, vxlan_tool is run blocking 80 destination port so that client-\u003eserver traffic is blocked. 3rd check, vxlan_tool is run blocking 22222 destination port so that server-\u003eclient traffic is blocked. 4rd check is just just the same as the 1st check to verify test ends with same config as at the beginning.",
