I could have understood a classical function just for a little help...\n\nHopefully you don\u0027t use it as a Singleton as it had been used in Functest.\n\nLast but not the least you\u0027re linking SFC to a project which is rolling and the drawbacks are huge compared to the benefits.\n\nBut you\u0027re free to merge your change.",
