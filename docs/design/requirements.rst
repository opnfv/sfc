Requirements
------------

This section defines requirements for the initial OPNFV SFC implementation,
including those requirements driving upstream project enhancements.

Minimal Viable Requirement
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Deploy a complete SFC solution by integrating OpenDaylight SFC with OpenStack
in an OPNFV environment.

Detailed Requirements
+++++++++++++++++++++

These are the Brahmaputra specific requirements:

1 Placement of SFs on only one Compute node will be supported.

2 The supported Service Chaining encapsulation will be NSH VXLAN-GPE.

3 The version of OVS used must support NSH.

4 The SF VM life cycle will be managed by the Tacker VNF Mgr.

5 The supported classifiers will be either ODL Netvirt or ODL GBP.

6 ODL will be the OpenStack Neutron backend and will handle all networking
  on the compute nodes.

Long Term Requirements
++++++++++++++++++++++

These requirements are out of the scope of the Brahmaputra release.

1 Placing SFs on multiple Compute nodes.

2 Dynamic movement of SFs across multiple Compute nodes.

3 Load Balancing across multiple SFs
