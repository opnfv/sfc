The `OPNFV Service Function Chaining (SFC) <https://wiki.opnfv.org/sfc>`_ project aims to provide the ability to define an ordered list of a network services (e.g. firewalls, NAT, QoS). These service are then "stitched" together in the network to create a service chain. This project provides the infrastructure to install the upstream ODL SFC implementation project in an NFV environment.
