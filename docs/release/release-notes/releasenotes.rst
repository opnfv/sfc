Abstract
========

This document compiles the release notes for the Danube release of
OPNFV SFC

Important notes
===============

These notes provide release information for the use of SFC with the Fuel
and Apex installer tools for the Danube release of OPNFV.

Summary
=======

The goal of the SFC Danube release is to integrate the OpenDaylight
SFC project into an OPNFV environment, with either the Fuel or Apex
installer. In subsequent releases, other OPNFV installers will be
considered.

More information about OpenDaylight and SFC can be found here.

Known Limitations, Issues and Workarounds
=========================================

System Limitations
------------------

The Danube 3.0 release has two limitations:

1 - The symmetric test case only works when client, server and
SFs are running in the same compute host. This is due to a missing
functionality in Tacker

JIRA: https://jira.opnfv.org/browse/SFC-86

2 - The test cases don't work in topologies where the client is not collocated
with a SF in one compute. The reason is that ODL Boron only creates a
classification rule in the computes with SFs. Therefore, the traffic from the
client goes to the server as it would be done without SFC (SFC classifier is
implemented only in the other compute). Having the SFs collocated with the
server and the client alone in other server does not work either because the
classification only classify traffic from local taps.


Known issues
------------

OpenDaylight SFC relies on a version of Open vSwitch (OVS) with
Network Service Headers (NSH). A version of OVS with NSH currently
exists, but it is in a branched version of OVS. Extensive upstream
work has been done to merge the NSH patches into mainstream OVS,
but the work is still not complete. More information about this
can be found in the OPNFV SFC design document (link provided above).

Workarounds
-----------

The way OpenStack handles VXLAN-GPE tunnels doesnt work well with
SFC, since OpenStack terminates the VXLAN tunnels in the br-int
bridge instead of the SF VM. Ideally, the tunnel should be terminated
in the VM so the SF has access to the NSH header carried in the tunnel.
A workaround was created to send the packets to the SF VM with the
VXLAN-GPE headers intact and can be found in the OPNFV SFC design
document (link provided above).

Test results
============
The Danube release of SFC has undergone QA test runs
with Functest tests on the Fuel and Apex installers.
