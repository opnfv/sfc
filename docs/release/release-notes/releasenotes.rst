Known Limitations, Issues and Workarounds
=========================================

System Limitations
------------------

The Fraser 1.0 release has a few limitations:

1 - The testcase sfc_two_chains_SSH_and_HTTP is disabled in this release due to
a missing feature in ODL. We are unable to currently update a chain config

Known issues
------------

1 - When tacker is deployed without Mistral, there is an ERROR in the logs and
the VIM is always in 'PENDING' state because tacker cannot monitor its health.
However, everything works and SFs can be created.

2 - When tacker is deployed without barbican, it cannot be in HA mode because
barbican is the only way to fetch the fernet keys.

Workarounds
-----------

Test results
============
The Fraser release of SFC has undergone QA test runs with Functest tests on the
Apex and Compass installers and xci utility
